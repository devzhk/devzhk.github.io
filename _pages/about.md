**Biography**: I am currently a PhD candidate at Caltech in Computing + Mathematical Sciences advised by [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/). Before Caltech, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020.

My research interests lie in the realm of deep generative modeling and inverse problems. I develop scalable and efficient generative models and design algorithms to solve ill-posed problems in a probabilistic framework. 

I am supported by PIMCO Data Science Graduate Fellowship.  

I enjoy photography in my spare time. You can find my photography portfolio on [this website](https://hzphotography.myportfolio.com/).
