**Biography**: I am currently a PhD candidate at Caltech in Computing + Mathematical Sciences advised by [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/). Before Caltech, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020.

My research interests primarily lie in advancing generative modeling techniques and exploring their applications to inverse problems. Currently, I particularly focus on diffusion models and their role in solving inverse problems.

I am supported by PIMCO Data Science Gradudate Fellowhip.
